# Portfolio Challenge

## UCB Bootcamp Challenge 02

My motivation for this project was to push my limits in terms of my HTML and CSS capabilities.

This project was done to dive even deeper into my learning process when it comes to learning what employers might want when creating a project from scratch.

All that was provided for this challenge was a list of requirements which might be provided by a potential employer as well as a mockup/sample. It was up to me to decide how to structure then code it and I had a lot of fun!

This was an awesome learning experience, I learned so much about CSS and its capabilities as well as how to better structure my pages via HTML.
